To run allure report you would need allure dependency added in your virtual env.
1. First method: Run the command --> pipenv allure-pytest
2. Second Method: Go to Python Interpretor and add dependency
Then you have to create an empty folder to save the screenshots that will be captured.
Once that is done run the below commands.
1. pytest alluredir="directory_path(replace this will actual path)" LoginPage.py
The above commad will create json dumps that stores results of your executed tests
2. To load the report in html format on local port allure serve "directory_path(replace with actual path)"
